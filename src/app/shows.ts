  description:
    "Adored by millions, Judy Garland wowed us from the time she was a teenager in pigtails singing &quot;Over the Rainbow,&quot; to her legendary 1961 come-back Carnegie Hall concert in what The New York Times called &quot;the concert of the century.&quot; Set both on the stage of Carnegie Hall and in Garland 's mind, <b> <i> Beyond the Rainbow </i></b> simultaneously treats its audience to the famed concert while telling the life story of one of Hollywood's most unforgettable legends.",
