    <h2>Beyond the Rainbow</h2>
    <h3>The Judy Garland Musical</h3>
    <p class="description">Adored by millions, Judy Garland wowed us from the time she was a teenager in pigtails
      singing “Over the Rainbow,” to her legendary 1961 come-back Carnegie Hall concert in what The New York Times
      called, “the concert of the century.” Set both on the stage of Carnegie Hall and in Garland’s mind, <b><i>Beyond
          the
          Rainbow</i></b> simultaneously treats its audience to the famed concert while telling the life story of one
      of
      Hollywood’s most unforgettable legends.</p>
