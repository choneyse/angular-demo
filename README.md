# Farmers Alley Theatre Angular Demo Project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.3 and is intended as to demonstrate some Angular items in my first ever Angular project including:

1. Angular Components
2. Basic Routing and active states
3. Routing and CSS animations
4. Form validation and data capture
5. Using CSS variables

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
